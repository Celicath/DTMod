# DTMod
This mod adds a character named `The Dragon Tamer` to Slay the Spire. Dragon Tamer fights alongside with his Dragon.

Dragon Tamer and Dragon both have low HP (40 and 45 respectively), so they need teamwork to overcome difficulties.

# Dragon
Dragon is a separate character with its own HP, Block and buffs. You control both 'You' and 'Dragon' by playing corresponding cards.

Dragon will attack when you play a card saying `Dragon deals X damage`. Dragon will gain Block with a card `Dragon gains X Block`, and similar for other buffs.

Dragon faints (instead of die) when its HP becomes 0. It will revive with 1 HP at the end of combat.


### Make dragon evolve!
Dragon starts each run as Baby Dragon. Baby Dragon is a Tier 1 dragon with no special abilities.

After beating act 1 and act 2 boss, Dragon will evolve into one of the dragons from higher tier. Each dragon has unique abilities similar to relics.

Some dragons have deck requirements to be able to choose. For example, you need to have 8 Attack cards in your deck at the end of Act 1 to evolve into Red Dragon.


# Aggro and Position
With 2 characters, enemies have to decide which character to attack.
In this mod, all enemies attack the Front, the one with higher Aggro.

You and Dragon gain Aggro whenever they attack. Aggro increases by 1 per hit, but only 1 when you attack multiple enemies at the same time using AOE attack. 

Only the difference between You and Dragon is displayed. The one with higher aggro will become the Front, and lower will become the Rear. When they become same, Front & Rear are not exchanged.

Some cards activate when you switch position, and other cards affect only the Front or the Rear.
Thus, you may want to carefully control who becomes the Front at what time.


# Other stuff

* Channeling: Effects happen after 2 turns, but cancelled if you Attack or enemies attack you.
* Synergies with Burn / Weak.
* Cards with while-in-your-deck effects.
