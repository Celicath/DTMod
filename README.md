# DTMod
This mod adds a character named `The Dragon Tamer` to Slay the Spire. Dragon Tamer fights alongside with his Dragon.

Dragon Tamer and Dragon both have low HP (45 and 50 respectively), so they need teamwork to overcome difficulties.

# Dragon
Dragon is a separate character with its own HP, Block and buffs. You control both 'You' and 'Dragon' by playing corresponding cards.

Dragon will attack when you play a card saying `Dragon deals X damage`. Dragon will gain Block with a card `Dragon gains X Block`, and similar for other buffs.

Dragon faints (instead of die) when its HP becomes 0. It will revive with 1 HP at the end of combat.
Dragon heals with rest or between Acts, as you normally do.


### Make dragon evolve!
Dragon starts each run as Baby Dragon. Baby Dragon is a Tier 1 dragon with no special abilities.

After beating act 1 and act 2 boss, Dragon will evolve into one of the dragons from higher tier. Each dragon has unique abilities similar to relics.

Some dragons have deck requirements to be able to choose. For example, you need to have 8 Attack cards in your deck at the end of Act 1 to evolve into Red Dragon, who gets +1 Strength each combat.


# Aggro and Position
With 2 characters, enemies have to decide which character to attack.
In this mod, all enemies attack the Front, the one with higher Aggro.

You and Dragon gain Aggro whenever they attack. Aggro increases by 1 per hit, but only 1 when you attack multiple enemies at the same time using AOE attacks.

Only the difference between Your and Dragon's Aggro is displayed, because that's all you need to know.
When the difference of Aggro becomes 0, the Front and the Rear remain unchanged. They only exchange their position when the Aggro of the Rear becomes higher than the Front. This exchange is keyworded as 'Switch'.

### Control the Positions
To prevent damage from enemies, you generally want to give Block to the Front. Target Defense from your starting deck does exactly that.
However, there are other cards which give Block to only one character (You or Dragon), or even the Rear.
To make advantage of these cards, you need to actively Switch. Switching Tactic from your starting deck helps that, by reversing Aggro.
Of course, you may find other ways to use the Rear's Block.

# Other stuff

* Channeling: Powerful effects activate after 2 turns, but cancelled if You attack or an enemy attack You.
* Synergies with Base game mechanics: Burn, Weak, Innate
* Cards with while-in-your-deck effects.
