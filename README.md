# DTMod
This mod adds a character named `The Dragon Tamer` to Slay the Spire. Dragon Tamer fights alongside with his Dragon.

Dragon Tamer and Dragon both have low HP (45 and 50 respectively), so they need teamwork to survive.

# Dragon
Dragon is a separate character with its own HP, Block and buffs. You control both 'You' and 'Dragon' by playing corresponding cards.

For example, Dragon will attack when you play a card saying `Dragon deals X damage`, or gain Block with `Dragon gains X Block`. Similar for buffs and other effects.

When Dragon's HP becomes 0, it faints and cannot move. However, it will revive with 1 HP at the end of combat.

Things affecting you may or may not affect Dragon: 
- Dragon heals when you rest or clear an Act.
- Events don't affect Dragon's HP.
- Most enemy powers affecting the player now affects the Front. (Sharp Hide, Explosive, Beat of Death, etc.)
  - Thorns only affect the attacker.
- You can make Dragon to drink some potions.
- Most base game relics only affect you. Exceptions include Ginger, Turnip and Odd Mushroom.

Some of these might change in the future.


### Make dragon evolve!
Dragon starts each run as Baby Dragon. Baby Dragon is a Tier 1 dragon with no special abilities.

After beating act 1 and act 2 boss, Dragon will evolve into one of the dragons from higher tier. Each dragon has unique abilities similar to relics.

Some dragons have deck requirements to be able to choose. For example, you need to have 8 Attack cards in your deck at the end of Act 1 to evolve the Dragon into Red Dragon. (Red Dragon gets +1 Strength at the start of each combat.)


# Aggro and Position
With 2 characters, enemies have to decide which character to attack.
In this mod, all enemies attack the Front, the one with higher Aggro.

You and Dragon gain Aggro whenever they attack. Aggro increases by 1 per hit, but only 1 when you attack multiple enemies at the same time using AOE attacks.

Only the difference between Your and Dragon's Aggro is displayed, because that's all you need to know.

When the Aggro of the Rear becomes higher than the Front, they exchange their position. This exchange is keyworded as 'Switch'.

### Control the Positions
To prevent damage from enemies, you generally want to give Block to the Front. The card `Target Defense` from your starting deck does exactly that.
However, many other cards give Block to only one character (You or Dragon), or even the Rear.
To take advantage of these cards, you need to actively Switch. Switching Tactic from your starting deck helps that, by reversing Aggro.
It's also possible to use the Rear's Block with other powers.
