# DTMod
This mod adds a named `The Dragon Tamer` to Slay the Spire, who plays as a team with Dragon.


# Dragon
Dragon is a separate character with own HP, Block and buffs. You control both You and Dragon by playing cards.

When you play a card saying `Dragon deals X damage`, dragon will attack.
Dragon can gain Block or buffs using cards with similar text.

When Dragon's HP becomes 0, it faints. When fainted, attacks by Dragon or effects affecting Dragon cannot be used. Fainted Dragon will revive with 1 HP at the end of combat.


### Make dragon evolve!
Dragon will evolve into tier 2 and 3 dragon after beating act 1 and 2.
There are 5 dragons for each tier, and each one has different abilities.
All dragons except the first one from each tier has requirements such as `8 Attack cards in your deck`. If you don't fulfill this requirement at the time you beat act 1 or act 2, Dragon cannot evolve into that one.


# Aggro and Position
With 2 characters, enemies have to prioritize which one from your team to attack.
In this mod, all enemies attack the Front, the one with higher Aggro.

You and Dragon gain Aggro whenever they attack. Aggro increases by 1 per hit, but only 1 when you attack multiple enemies at the same time using AOE attack. 

Only the difference between You and Dragon is important. The one with higher aggro will become the Front, and lower will become the Rear. When they become same, Front & Rear are not exchanged.

Some cards activate when you switch position, and others cards affect only the Front or the Rear.
Thus, you may want to carefully control who becomes the Front for efficient combat.

* Channeling: Effects happen after 2 turns, but cancelled if you Attack or enemies attack you.
